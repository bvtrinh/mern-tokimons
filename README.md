An assignment that was given during one of my software engineering courses.
I thought it was a good practice exercise for a CRUD app and liked the concepts of "Tokimons".
This was derived from my earlier iteration of it using only
server side rendering with EJS and Express.

## ‚ú® Features

- Add a Tokimon to the database

This app was deployed via Docker and Heroku. The React app was bundled up and the `index.html` file is being served by the Express server. To setup up and deploy the app:

```bash
cd server
# Create production build
npm run build:prod

# Build docker image
docker build -t tokimons-app .

# Login to container registry
heroku container:login

# Create a Heroku app
heroku create

# NOTE: Setup your env variables in your Heroku dashboard for the app

# Push to the container registry
heroku container:push web

# Deploy the container to your Heroku app
heroku container:release web

# Open it in your browser
heroku open
```
